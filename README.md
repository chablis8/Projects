# Projects

## Automomus (Autonomous.ipynb)
- We tried to understand the current progress of autonomous driving. The data records disengagement from Dec 2018 to Nov 2019. 
The average distances between each disengagement (auto drive testing) are visualized in order to understand the AD persistancy of each manufacturer.

## Salary Prediction (Salary_Prediction_01.ipynb)
- Using different variables (Job Types, Years of Experience, Education Level, Industry and so on) of individual and their corresponding salary level, we 
visualized the potential correlations among those variables and developed several machine learning models 
(Lasso, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boost Regressor) to learn from historical data and finally we use the most accurate one (Gradient Boost Regressor)
to predict the expected salary of the new comers.

## Sales Volume Prediction (times_series_analysis.ipynb)
- Using the time series model - Seasonal ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), we visualized 8 years of monthly sales volume data, using the autocorrelation charts to see which lag(s) of historical data are most related to the current volume, trained the time series model and use it to preduct the next 24 month sales volume.
